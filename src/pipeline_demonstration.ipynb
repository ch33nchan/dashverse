    "\n",
    "The pipeline is engineered for scalability to meet the demands of processing millions of images. Here are the key architectural features that enable this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed Task Processing:** The system is integrated with **Celery**, a powerful distributed task queue. This allows the workload to be distributed across multiple worker machines, enabling horizontal scaling. You can start multiple Celery workers to process images in parallel, drastically reducing the total processing time for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimized Batch Processing:** The pipeline processes images in batches, which is significantly more efficient than processing them one by one. This leverages the full power of modern GPUs and CPUs, maximizing throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced Caching:** To avoid redundant computations, the pipeline includes an `AdvancedCache` component. This component caches intermediate results, such as image embeddings. When the same image or a similar one is processed again, the cached results can be reused, saving valuable computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Data Handling:** For large-scale data loading and preprocessing, the pipeline uses Hugging Face's `datasets` library and PyTorch's `DataLoader`. These tools are designed for performance and can handle massive datasets with ease, providing features like memory mapping and parallel data loading."
